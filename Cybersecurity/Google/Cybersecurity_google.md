# Cybersecurity Google Course

## Introduction to cybersecurity
Practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of information by protection networks, devices, people and data from unauthorized access of criminal exploitation.

 - Threat actor : any person or group who presents a security risk
 - Benefits of security: Protects the organization from internal and external threats. Will help organization mitigate risks. Meets regulatory compliance. Maintan and improve business productivity, reduces expenses. Maintan brand trust

Organizations must prepare for risks and minimize damages.

 ## Why security matters

- Business continuity and ethical standing. 
 - maintain organization security and data too.
 - increase trust for the company
 - PII - Personally identifiable information - stricter handling guidelines for SPII (security personally identifiable info)


## Security professional core

- Security analysts often use analytical thinking, which means to think carefully and thoroughly. Analysts use this skill when monitoring and securing computer and network systems, responding to potential threats, defining system privileges, and determining ways to mitigate risk.
- Collaboration : means working with stakeholders and other team members. Security analysts often use this skill when responding to an active threat. They'll work with others when blocking unauthorized access and ensuring any compromised systems are restored.
- Malware Prevention: When a specific threat or vulnerability is identified, an analyst might install prevention software, which is software that works to proactively prevent a threat from occurring. Because malware is designed to harm devices or networks, malware prevention is essential.
- Communication: As an analyst prevents and encounters threats, risks, or vulnerabilities, they document and report findings. A report might detail attempts to secure systems, test weak points, or offer solutions for system improvement. When reporting findings, strong communication skills are important.
- Programming language: Analysts may sometimes work with software development teams to analyze and support security, install software, and set up appropriate processes. When involved with software development projects, it can be helpful for an analyst to understand programming language
- SIEM tools: When security analysts need to review vulnerabilities, they conduct a periodic security audit. This is a review of an organization’s records, activities, and related documents. During audits, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools help analysts better understand security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.


## History of cybersecurity

- why the area grew? Cyberatacks in the 80s and 90s
- It's important to understand pasts atacks

Types of atacks:
- Computer virus : A computer virus is malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software
- Malware : Today, viruses are more commonly referred to as malware, which is software designed to harm devices or networks. Two examples of early malware attacks that we'll cover are the Brain virus and the Morris worm.

With the expansion of reliable high-speed internet, the number of computers connected to the internet increased dramatically. Because malware could spread through the internet, threat actors no longer needed to use physical disks to spread viruses.

- Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Today, it's common for employees to receive training on how to identify social engineering attacks. Specifically, phishing through the emails they receive. Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.

## Common attacks

- Phishing: Use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software
        - Business Email Compromise (BEC): A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.

        - Spear phishing: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.

        - Whaling: A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.

        - Vishing: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

        - Smishing: The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

- Malware is a software designed to harm devices or networks
- Social Engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information

## Security frameworks and controls

- First you have to identifying our organization critical assets and risks. Then we need to implement the necessary frameworks and controls

- Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle. The security lifecycle is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards that define how an organization manages risks, follows established guidelines, and meets regulatory compliance, or laws.

- The purpose of security frameworks include protecting personally identifiable information, known as PII, securing financial information, identifying security weaknesses, managing organizational risks, and aligning security with business goals.

- Components of framework: The first core component is identifying and documenting security goals. For example, an organization may have a goal to align with the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation, also known as GDPR.  The second core component is setting guidelines to achieve security goals. For example, when implementing guidelines to achieve GDPR compliance, your organization may need to develop new policies for how to handle data requests from individual users. TThe second core component is setting guidelines to achieve security goals. For example, when implementing guidelines to achieve GDPR compliance, your organization may need to develop new policies for how to handle data requests from individual users.The last core component of security frameworks is monitoring and communicating results. As an example, you may monitor your organization's internal network and report a potential security issue affecting GDPR to your manager or regulatory compliance officer.

- Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. For example, your company may have a guideline that requires all employees to complete a privacy training to reduce the risk of data breaches. As a security analyst, you may use a software tool to automatically assign and track which employees have completed this training.

## Secure design

- CIA triad is a foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk
        - Confidentiality means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. For example, strict access controls that define who should and should not have access to data, must be put in place to ensure confidential data remains safe.
        - Integrity means the data is correct, authentic, and reliable. To maintain integrity, security professionals can use a form of data protection like encryption to safeguard data from being tampered with.
        - Availability means data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it. Let's define a term that came up during our discussion of the CIA triad
- Asset : is an item perceived as having value to an organization. For example, an application that stores sensitive data, such as social security numbers or bank accounts, is a valuable asset to an organization.

- NIST cybersecurity framework - voluntary framework that consists of standarts and guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk


## Ethics in cybersecurity

- We need to remain unbiased and maintain security and confidentiality

Ethical principles:
        - Confidentiality : you will encounter proprietary or private information, it is ethical to keep information confidential
